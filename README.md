# Project: sdt
Python/NumPy/SciPy implementation of the deterministic version of the Stochastic Distance Transform (SDT). (Ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08097)

The SDT is a tunably noise-insensitive distance transform (a distance map from all elements of an image domain to its nearest object element). Both binary and integer-valued images are supported, where the integer-valued images act as multisets.
